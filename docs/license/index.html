<p>Compliance with Human Rights Laws and Human Rights Principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Human Rights Laws. The Software shall not be used by any person or
    entity for any systems, activities, or other uses that violate any
    applicable laws, regulations, or rules that protect human, civil, labor,
    privacy, political, environmental, security, economic, due process, or

    fees, arising out of or relating to Licensee&rsquo;s non-compliance with this
    License or use of the Software in violation of Human Rights Laws or
    Human Rights Principles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enforceability: If any portion or provision of this License is determined to
     be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction,
